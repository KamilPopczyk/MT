# Memes task

Solution of given task.

## Getting Started

Clone repository. Import calculate function from _main.py_ file.

### Prerequisites

Python version:

```
Python 3.7
```

### Solution of task

I defined this task as 0-1 knapsack problem. I decided to solve it with 
dynamic algorithm. 

At first I define two classes of Meme and USBSticks. This two classes,
extend quite a lot of size of code, but maybe xXxDankScavengerxXx will
like a lot this script and wanted to fully automate usb sticks making.
These two classes can easily extended for future purpose.

Algorithm create matrix of possible usb sticks. Then try maximize price of
memes on them. 
## Running the tests

Solution of task was delivered with mini unit test. File test:
```
